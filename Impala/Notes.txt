invalidate metadata

refresh <table>

profile; (run afte query) (exec plan)

summary;

to insert data -> insert overwrite table <query>

-> No delete exists


shift + insert -> copy data

- make sure the table has correct rights. Use chmod -R 777 /<path>/db and then run the refresh <table>


- Impala doesn't use Map Reduce, thus it's faster (written in C++). Also, if a node fails, it doesn't lunch it in another one, as Hive does

- Execute in shell script

impala-shell -d <db name> -q "<query> $1"

sh -x <script name>

- show create table <table name>: shows the DDL of a table
- show partitions <table name>: shows the partitions of a table
